## Delegation

Apply this delegation policy in Claude Code sessions.

When acting as the primary agent, delegate independent work when it materially
improves speed or quality. Handle small tasks directly and keep orchestration,
scope decisions, integration, and final verification in the primary agent. For
non-trivial changes, plan and delegate rather than implementing them yourself.
A change is non-trivial when it spans more than one module or touches routing,
guards, schema, or tests.

- Use `runner` for bounded read-only lookups, file discovery, and factual checks.
- Use the built-in `Explore` agent for tracing behavior across the codebase and
  `Plan` for research during plan mode. Include relevant project constraints in
  their assignments because these built-ins skip CLAUDE.md.
- Use `fixer` to implement a defined change within assigned files and verify it.
- Use `inspector` for independent assessment of a supplied diff for correctness,
  regressions, security issues, and missing validation.
  Pass the diff or artifacts, requirements, and check results, not the author's
  reasoning, so the review stays independent. Always review high-risk changes with
  the default inspector: renames that reach the schema or stored codes, removing
  routes or guards, anything without a rollback, and these Opus types:
  - migrations, including squashing or rewriting history
  - authentication or authorization changes, including sessions, tokens, and
    crypto
  - tenant-isolation scoping
  - payment, billing, or financial record logic (balances, fund allocations,
    closed-period locks)
  - audit logging, including atomic change-and-audit writes and the fields audit
    entries record
  - sensitive or personal data handling: encryption, masking, reveal routes, and
    anything that could copy it into logs, errors, or audit entries
  - data deletion

  For the Opus types, also run one Opus review without asking the user: spawn
  `inspector` with the Agent tool's `model: "opus"` override at medium effort, on
  the settled diff before the PR or final handoff. Use the default inspector while
  iterating, so the costly pass sees only the final diff. Give the Opus inspector the diff,
  requirements, and check results, but not the earlier inspector's findings.
  After fixing its findings, review the fix diff with the default inspector, and
  rerun the Opus review only if the fix itself falls in those Opus types. Report
  in your summary that the Opus review ran and what it found. A user's approval of
  a plan does not replace review.
- Use `consultant` before recommending on any architecture or design question: a
  choice between viable options, a data model, API, or integration decision, or a
  change that is hard to reverse, such as rewriting migration history or renaming
  domain concepts across packages. Skip it only when the answer is obvious or the
  question is a small lookup. Also use it for a bug that two attempts have not
  fixed. Gather the relevant files and findings first and put them in the
  assignment, so it reasons over them instead of searching. Include the AGENTS.md
  sections and specs that state a rule on the topic (grep for it), because a
  consultant that sees only code argues from a stale comment. State a tighter
  tool-call budget for a narrow question.
- Give a `fixer` that writes docs, ADRs, or API descriptions the implementing diff
  or file paths, and have it check each claim against that code. A brief alone
  yields unverified prose.
- Prefer the configured `inspector` over plugin reviewer agents; use a plugin
  agent only when its specialty (for example security audit or test design) is
  what the task needs.
- Use the built-in `general-purpose` agent for mixed investigation and action
  when no specialist fits. It can spawn agents, so tell it in the assignment not
  to delegate further.
- Use each agent's configured model unless this policy names another. Choose a supported reasoning effort for its
  task: low for simple lookups, medium for routine implementation, and high for
  complex investigation or review. Respect explicit user requests for effort.
- Pass the chosen effort through the Agent tool's per-invocation effort parameter
  for non-fork subagents. Respect the `CLAUDE_CODE_EFFORT_LEVEL` environment
  override when set.
- Give each assignment its objective, relevant context, file ownership or read-only
  scope, acceptance criteria, and expected evidence. Give inspectors the diff,
  baseline, requirements, and available test results; their tools cannot run git
  or tests. State a tighter tool-call budget for a narrow review.
- Resolve required investigation and decisions before starting dependent fixers.
  Parallelize independent work with distinct file ownership to avoid edit conflicts:
  list the owned files in each assignment, make sure no two fixers share one, and
  run work that must touch the same file sequentially.
- Tell each `fixer` to run only the checks for its owned files (lint those paths
  with the repo's own linter, autofixing only those paths, not its repo-wide
  lint or fix command),
  and never a test project that shares a database with another running fixer. State
  that this overrides the project's pre-handoff checks; the primary runs those.
  Tell it to also run the type-check for its owned paths and the project's
  database-free guard specs when the repo names them (for example `pnpm test:guards`).
  For rename and move assignments, grep the repo's root `test/` for the old paths
  and names first, and list each matching spec as an owned file, because guard
  specs hard-code paths and fixtures. For rename assignments, tell it to change prose and identifiers only and to leave
  stored codes (audit actions, module keys, table names), import paths, and SQL
  literals unchanged unless the assignment lists them. Run the full
  lint, type-check, and test suites once yourself, after integration, and never
  two test runs at once.
- Integrate changes before reviewing the combined result. Use independent review
  for meaningful changes and handle trivial edits directly.
- Resolve missing context and scope dependencies in the primary agent, then resume
  `runner`, `inspector`, `consultant`, `fixer`, or `general-purpose` with
  `SendMessage` and the additional context. `Explore` and `Plan` cannot be resumed;
  start a new one. When a subagent returns partial, hits its turn limit, or returns
  no report, resume it and ask it to report now from what it has, listing what it
  did not verify. Do not restart it.
  Verify returned work and review findings, fix confirmed defects, and rerun the
  checks affected by each fix.

When acting as a delegated subagent, complete the assigned task directly and
return the result to the primary agent. Leave further delegation to the primary.

## Tool economy

Search with Grep/Glob, not shell grep/find (zsh errors on unquoted globs). When
Grep is unavailable, use `git grep`, which skips untracked build output. Edit files with Edit, not `sed -i` (BSD sed on macOS differs) or scripted string replacement: a pattern that no longer matches changes nothing and reports success, while Edit fails loudly.

In zsh, quote words that start with `=` (`echo '====='`), which zsh otherwise
expands as a command path. Write temporary files to the session scratchpad, never
to a relative path outside the repository.
