## Meet the Detective Crew

![The Detective Crew](assets/detective-crew/detective-crew.png)

Your main agent is the Chief: it coordinates the case, makes the decisions,
integrates changes, and verifies the outcome. The crew does the legwork.

| | Crew member | Question it answers | Expected result |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| <img src="assets/detective-crew/runner.svg" alt="Runner" width="72"> | **Runner** | Where is it, and what are the facts? | A concise answer with file or source references |
| <img src="assets/detective-crew/fixer.svg" alt="Fixer" width="72"> | **Fixer** | Can you implement the agreed solution? | Scoped changes, relevant checks, and their outcomes |
| <img src="assets/detective-crew/inspector.svg" alt="Inspector" width="72"> | **Inspector** | Does this change work correctly, and what did we miss? | Concrete findings with impact and evidence, or no findings with verification limits |
| <img src="assets/detective-crew/consultant.svg" alt="Consultant" width="72"> | **Consultant** | Which approach should we take, and why? | A recommendation, alternatives, trade-offs, risks, and supporting evidence |
| <img src="assets/detective-crew/tracker.svg" alt="Tracker" width="72"> | **Tracker** (Codex only) | How does this work, and what caused the problem? | Execution paths, likely causes, evidence, and remaining uncertainty |

### Models per tool

| Tool | `runner` | `fixer` | `inspector` | `consultant` | `tracker` | `default` | `explore` | `general` |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Codex | `gpt-6-luna` | `gpt-6.1-terra` | `gpt-6.1-sol` | `gpt-6-astra` | `gpt-6-luna` | `gpt-6.1-sol` | N/A | N/A |
| Claude Code | `claude-haiku-5-5`, medium | `claude-sonnet-5-5`, medium | `claude-sonnet-5-5`, high | `claude-opus-5-5`, high | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A |
| OpenCode | `opencode-go/muse-spark-1.3-contributor`, high | `opencode-go/deepseek-v4.1-flash`, max | `opencode-go/deepseek-v4.1-flash`, max | `opencode-go/glm-5.3-flash`, max | N/A | N/A | `opencode-go/muse-spark-1.3-contributor`, high | `opencode-go/deepseek-v4.1-flash`, max |
| Grok Build | `grok-4.7`, low | `grok-4.7`, medium | `grok-4.7`, high | `grok-4.7`, xhigh | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A |

N/A means the tool doesn't get that role. Codex leaves effort to the Chief at
spawn time, so its row lists models only. `default` (Codex) and `general`
(OpenCode) handle mixed work; `explore` (OpenCode) traces code.

## How a case runs

Use only the stages a task needs. Small tasks stay with the Chief.

1. **Gather evidence**: Runner looks things up; Tracker (or a built-in explorer) traces deeper.
2. **Consult**: Consultant weighs in on an unresolved design decision, or after two failed bug-fix attempts.
3. **Implement**: Fixer makes the agreed change in the files it owns.
4. **Inspect**: Inspector reviews the combined diff against the requirements.

A failing test with a clear cause can go straight to Fixer, then Inspector.
Read-only roles can't run shell commands or tests, so hand them the diff and
test output.

## The crew in each tool

Each tool gets its own delegation policy. Full per-tool rules, permissions, and
effort levels are in [docs/orchestration.md](docs/orchestration.md).

### Claude orchestration

| Agent | Assignment | Configuration |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `runner` | Bounded factual lookup or file discovery with references | Haiku 5.5, medium; max 15 turns, reports from 12 tool calls; Read, Glob, Grep, WebFetch, WebSearch |
| `fixer` | Implement an agreed change within owned files and verify it | Sonnet 5.5, medium; no turn limit; inherited tools, including shell, editing, skills, and MCP; Agent disabled |
| `inspector` | Review a supplied diff for concrete defects and explain their impact | Sonnet 5.5, high; max 60 turns, reports from 50 tool calls; Read, Glob, Grep, WebFetch, WebSearch |
| `consultant` | Advise on architecture, design trade-offs, and stubborn bugs; use sparingly | Opus 5.5, high; max 30 turns, reports from 24 tool calls; Read, Glob, Grep, WebFetch, WebSearch |
| `Explore` built-in | Trace behavior and dependencies across the codebase | Built-in read-only tools |
| `Plan` built-in | Gather research during plan mode | Built-in read-only tools |
| `general-purpose` built-in | Mixed investigation and action without a matching specialist | Built-in available tools |

High-risk changes always get an Inspector review. The riskiest also get one
Opus review; [claude/docs/opus-review.md](claude/docs/opus-review.md) lists
which changes qualify and the steps.

### Codex orchestration

| Agent | Assignment | Configuration |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `runner` | Bounded factual lookup or file discovery with references | Luna; read-only sandbox |
| `fixer` | Implement an agreed change within owned files and verify it | Terra; inherited permissions |
| `inspector` | Review a specified diff for concrete defects and explain their impact | Sol; read-only sandbox |
| `consultant` | Advise on architecture, difficult trade-offs, and stubborn bugs | Astra; read-only sandbox |
| `tracker` | Trace behavior, dependencies, and likely causes across files | Luna; read-only sandbox |
| `default` | Bounded mixed investigation and implementation without a matching specialist | Sol; inherited permissions |

Read-only roles run with `sandbox_mode = "read-only"`. Effort isn't fixed: the
Chief picks it for each task when spawning.

### OpenCode orchestration

| Agent | Assignment | Configuration |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `runner` | Bounded factual lookup or file discovery | Muse Spark 1.3 Contributor, high; inherited permissions |
| `fixer` | Implement an agreed change and verify it | DeepSeek V4.1 Flash, max; inherited permissions |
| `inspector` | Review a supplied diff for concrete defects | DeepSeek V4.1 Flash, max; inspection tools |
| `consultant` | Advise on unresolved design choices and stubborn bugs | GLM-5.3-Flash, max; inspection tools |
| `explore` | Trace behavior and dependencies across files | Muse Spark 1.3 Contributor, high; built-in exploration permissions |
| `general` | Mixed investigation and implementation | DeepSeek V4.1 Flash, max; built-in general permissions |

Inspector and Consultant can only read, search, and fetch. `explore` and
`general` are OpenCode's built-in agents with this setup's models.

### Grok orchestration

| Agent | Assignment | Configuration |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `runner` | Bounded factual lookup or file discovery | Grok 4.7, low; inherited capabilities |
| `fixer` | Implement an agreed change and verify it | Grok 4.7, medium; inherited capabilities |
| `inspector` | Review a supplied diff for concrete defects | Grok 4.7, high; read-only capability mode |
| `consultant` | Advise on unresolved design choices and stubborn bugs | Grok 4.7, xhigh; read-only capability mode |

All roles use Grok 4.7 at different efforts. Inspector and Consultant run in
read-only capability mode.

## Install, update, uninstall

Needs Node.js 18+ and Python 3. It installs configuration only, not the tools
themselves or credentials.

```sh
npx @rujealfon/detective-crew-agents                  # choose tools from a menu
npx @rujealfon/detective-crew-agents --tool claude    # skip the menu (repeatable)
npx @rujealfon/detective-crew-agents --dry-run        # preview changes
npx @rujealfon/detective-crew-agents --update         # upgrade an earlier install
npx @rujealfon/detective-crew-agents --uninstall      # remove recognized files
```

Files you've customized are never overwritten: the installer stops and reports
them. `--update` backs up each file it replaces. Start a fresh tool session
afterward.

| Tool | Delegation policy | Agents |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Codex | `~/.codex/AGENTS.md` | `~/.codex/agents/` |
| Claude Code | `~/.claude/rules/delegation.md` | `~/.claude/agents/` |
| OpenCode v2 | `~/.config/opencode/AGENTS.md` | `~/.config/opencode/agents/`, `opencode.jsonc` |
| Grok Build | `~/.grok/rules/delegation.md` | `~/.grok/agents/` |
